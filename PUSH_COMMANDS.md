# Git Push Commands

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```powershell
# Verify you're on main branch
git branch

# Verify remote is set
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If you get authentication errors, you may need to:
1. Use GitHub Personal Access Token instead of password
2. Or use GitHub Desktop
3. Or use SSH instead of HTTPS
